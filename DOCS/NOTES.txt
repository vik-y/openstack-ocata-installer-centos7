IMPORTANT NOTES !!

Be sure to have good knowledge of the following topics:

- Administration of Linux.
- Virtualization on Linux with kvm / qemu / libvirt.
- LinuxBridge and OpenVSwitch.
- Linux namespaces.
- Networks in general.
- OpenStack.
- NFS, GlusterFS.
- "Correct" Install of Centos 7 O/S.

This installer is ONLY for Centos 7 64-bit (x86_64 / amd64). Do not
attempt to use it in another environment.


1.- Base repositories and correct installation of Centos 7:

Install your centos 7 server with 64 bits and select the packages for a basic infraestructure server without
graphics environment. Do not include any extra repo like EPEL, ELREPO or RPMFORGE "yet", but you'll need to
include EPEL along the Newton RDO Repo.

If you are going to use a "Cinder Volume", remember to reserve the disk space for it.

Install RDO OpenStack OCATA Repos:

Centos:

yum install centos-release-openstack-ocata

RHEL:

yum install https://rdoproject.org/repos/rdo-release.rpm

Install EPEL:

yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

After installing RDO Newton and EPEL Repos, do a full update and reboot if necessary (new kernel installed):

yum -y upgrade
reboot

NOTE: The documentation at "https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/install-guide-rdo/environment-packages.html" states that you should disable EPEL repos while using RDO repositories due some version conflicts between both repos. Our installer already take care of this during install time by temporarily disabling EPEL repo during some package installation steps.


2.- System Control (/etc/sysctl.conf).

WARNING: This is VERY important!. Make sure you have the following items configured in 
/etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0

If you do not have configured this, please do it now and then reboot the machine.


3. OpenVSWITCH:

First install openvswitch. Run the commands below (after placing the repositories listed above):

yum -y install openvswitch

service openvswitch start

chkconfig openvswitch on

Then, create the bridges:

First step: br-int (OpenStack integration switch/bridge):

ovs-vsctl add-br br-int

Next step: br-enp0s9 (OpenStack networks switch/bridge). Example for "enp0s9" interface:

ovs-vsctl add-br br-enp0s9
ovs-vsctl add-port br-enp0s9 enp0s9

Please remember that in Centos the interfaces are using the new names. ethX is no longer used,
unless you are running a virtual machine with virtio (network).


NOTE: Always try to use an interface that is FREE and can be "dedicated" to OpenStack. 
For other configurations, see the information that is available online. It is not necessary 
to place the interfaces associated with the switches in /etc/network/interfaces, unless you 
have "shared" and not dedicated to OpenStack, or unless you are using special "vlan-based"
configurations.

For more information, please refer to OpenStack main documentation site:
